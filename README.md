# DataAnalyticsProject
A project on MovieLens Dataset as a part of the course Data Analytics at the **University of Sydney**. A collaboration of **Xavier Weber** and **Jeroen Vermazeren** who both attended an exchange semester at the University of Sydney whilst being students at Maastricht University. The repository contains a report on the research performed on the datasets.

**Remark**
The original files can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. Not all necessary files are included in this repository since they are quite big.
